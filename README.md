Types of test:


## Isolated Unit Test
Testing only what is inside of the class without the decorators, testing the value and what returns the function for example. Isolate the class and testing as a regular JS code.

## Shallow Integration Test
Gives us a way to test the component with it's template. Like ignore child directives. 

## Deep Integration Test
Integration test with Location child directives and interation testing with services
